# Magic Tiles VR

**Magic Tiles VR** is an immersive memory-based puzzle game developed in **Unity** using the **XR Interaction Toolkit**. Players watch a tile pattern sequence, then step on the correct tiles in order to progress through levels with increasing difficulty.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- Players enter a VR room and wait for tiles to "drop" from above.
- After a short delay, a pattern is visually highlighted.
- The player must physically step on the tiles in the correct sequence.
- Correct input progresses the level; incorrect input or timeout triggers a failure state.
- Each new level adds one more tile to the sequence.

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- Procedural pattern generation with increasing difficulty
- Drop animation for only active pattern tiles (non-pattern tiles are hidden)
- Step recognition with cooldown and validation logic
- Visual feedback via particle systems and sounds
- Failure handling on timeout or incorrect input
- Grab interactable for player interaction during active input phase
